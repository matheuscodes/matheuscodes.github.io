<p>omni:us enables organizations to lead in an AI-first world, by providing expertise in artificial intelligence with access to cutting-edge technology and deep domain knowledge. Using ingestion of digital documents and artificial intelligence in order extract information, omni:us optmizes insurance document handling processes. A Senior Backend Software Engineer, together with other Full Stack Engineers, needs to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Build complex enterprise systems, workflows and high-quality tools</li>
    <li>Design and develop the APIs encompassing the backend and business logic for omni:us.</li>
    <li>Write clean and reusable code</li>
    <li>Maintain software releases and versioning across multiple clients</li>
    <li>Work closely with product managers, data scientists and frontend engineers.</li>
    <li>Mentor junior team members and share industry best practices.</li>
    <li>Adopt agile practices for efficiency, predictability, and customer-driven product development.</li>
  </ul>
  When I joined omni:us they were in the process of moving from a proof of concept and project strategy to building a product over a platform. Some of my contributions to the company were:
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed and gathered a set of scattered demo applications under version control into a single environment.</li>
    <li>Supported the Full Stack team lead in setting up release processes, versioning and industry standards CI/CD infrastructure.</li>
    <li>Together with the team, designed and architected the harmonization of internal services into a service REST API.</li>
    <li>Personally set up the whole delivery and release structure of the service API, as well as its quality standards.</li>
    <li>Constantly supported and advised the management team on their introduction of agile methodologies, OKRs and team organization in Squads.</li>
  </ul>
