<p> ImmoScout24 is the leading online platform for residential and commercial properties in Germany.
    It has been revolutionizing the real estate market for over 20 years. With its digital
    solutions, ImmoScout24 provides orientation and successfully brings owners, brokers and property
    seekers together. The company is working towards the goal of handling real estate transactions
    digitally and thereby making complex decisions easier for its users. As part of my work, I was
    mainly responsible for the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Working with cutting-edge AWS frameworks on future-oriented trends and technologies</li>
    <li>Developing cloud-based backend microservices using Java, Kotlin and Typescript frameworks</li>
    <li>Designing and drafting product and architecture requirements in the form of small testable and functional components</li>
    <li>Implementing complex web UI features using React and Backstage plugins</li>
    <li>Using data-driven development and making decisions based on data</li>
    <li>Researching, defining and introducing standards for our company's tech teams</li>
</ul>
As particular work successes I can mention the following projects:
<ul>
    <li>Design and build a central reference for finding user information in the platform for GDPR compliance</li>
    <li>Improve customer support processes and contact pages through automation</li>
    <li>Migrate internal tools from a database-based login process to an OIDC-based SSO process</li>
    <li>Decouple and modularize the company's service delivery logic and product management logic from a legacy system into its own dedicated service</li>
    <li>Implement and deploy a new pricing and invoicing mechanism for a mortgage lead engine</li>
    <li>Design and build a system for measuring repository quality standards to compare with expected requirements and provide reports with calls to action to software developers</li>
    <li>Reduce the amount of code on legacy systems by about 20% through modularization and by removing unused functions and refactoring by about 10%</li>
</ul>
