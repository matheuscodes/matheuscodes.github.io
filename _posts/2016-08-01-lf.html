  Locafox is an omnichannel marketplace for lifestyle products as well as a digital sale system, so-called POS, for small and medium-sized retailers. Through such products, local retailers are introduced to smart online tools, being fostered in competition with online marketplaces. As a Data Integration Developer the responsibilities are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Transform, normalize and filter external sources of data to be imported to the system</li>
    <li>Develop new features or extend existing ones to cope with new and custom input feeds</li>
    <li>Design and maintain a scalable and flexible architecture to process sheer amounts of data</li>
    <li>Create and maintain automated test cases</li>
    <li>Troubleshoot and debug importation flows through the system from source to final index</li>
    <li>Support client services in maintaing or creating integrations to retailers</li>
    <li>Monitor the system metrics and alarms detecting problems to fix or notify responsible teams</li>
  </ul>
  I joined to company to take ownership of their NodeJS data processing system which normalizes data to be then later stored and enriched. Previously being handled as a group of individual scripts dedicated to each retailer, a new scalable system was in dire need to centralize functionality. Among general responsibilites some of my major undertakings were:
  <ul>
    <li>Totally refactored the paradigm on development from dedicated scripts to opitionated central code</li>
    <li>Created a fully flexible architecture based on pipelines and easily configurable building blocks</li>
    <li>Through refactoring and RCA to detect and mitigate issues reduced the technical integration time by 10 fold</li>
    <li>Set up code quality measurements raising standards to industry best practices using ESLint</li>
    <li>Developed a suite of integration and unit tests raising coverage to over 90% using Mocha, Chai and Istanbul</li>
    <li>Together with the DevOps team refactored the deployment stack to improve development process</li>
  </ul>
