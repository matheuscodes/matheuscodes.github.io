  Abroadwith is an open community marketplace for people to learn languages immersing in other cultures. Staying with a family in a remote town in northern France or living within a young community in buzzing Berlin, Abroadwith brings the opportunity to learn a language experiencing the culture first hand and sharing with local hosts. As the CTO, some of my main responsibilities were:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Frontend and backend development support</li>
    <li>Steady and creative expansion of platform functionalities</li>
    <li>Ensuring system and data integrity as well as the system and data security</li>
    <li>Monitor and optimize system performance and service quality</li>
    <li>Development of operations infrastructure and software processes</li>
    <li>Close collaboration with the marketing, sales and management teams</li>
  </ul>
  Being founded a couple months before I joined, the company was at its very early stage and our main focus was to ramp up the team, including not only hiring but also product development. Among my deeds towards those goals I:
  <ul>
    <li>Supported the company's CEO in defining product's concepts</li>
    <li>Defined the initial system architecture and coordinated development tasks between our two hired developers</li>
    <li>Developed the Frontend server infrastructure in NodeJS using Express and Nunjucks</li>
    <li>Configured Amazon Web Services and continuous integration</li>
    <li>Personally took care of implementing the following features:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Login process using password and social accounts</li>
      <li>Text and filter search using Apache Solr</li>
      <li>SMS authentication using Twilio</li>
      <li>Email templating for notifications with Sendgrid</li>
      <li>Multilanguage support for the Frontend using translation keys</li>
      <li>Image upload, processing and storage</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
